 abstract = {This paper characterises the energy and power density of a cell using a hybrid pulse power characterisation (HPPC) test and proposes the used of HPPC micro cycle based on offline data for feature extraction to distinguish between power and energy density of the cell in 80 s, which is significantly quicker. Electric vehicles (EV) typically have around 80{\%} of their initial capacity at the end of the battery life. It is widely anticipated that these EV batteries will retain significant capacity remaining and potentially operate for additional years in their second life. Finding ways to repurpose the batteries in home, industrial and grid-scale energy storage system (ESS) is becoming more urgent. Establishing or verifying battery performance in comparison to these targets is a principal objective. Non-availability of onboard diagnostics data and accurate assessments of the automotive and second use battery degradation stand out in particular. This paper characterises the energy and power density of a cell using a hybrid pulse power characterisation (HPPC) test. Experimental results from five randomly selected cells from disassemble Nissan leaf pack that reach end of life (EoL) shows that all the cells satisfied the ESS performance targets of electric vehicle (EV) of 700 W/Kg, 300 W/Kg during discharge/regen respectively. The paper further proposes the used of HPPC micro cycle based on offline data for feature extraction to distinguish between power and energy density of the cell in 80 s, which is significantly quicker.},

 abstract = {Circular business models, aimed at narrowing, slowing, and closing resource loops, can potentially generate significant economic and social benefits, promote resource security and improve environmental performance. However, within the wind power industry, sustainability research, including life cycle assessments, has been focused mostly on technology innovation at the material (e.g. permanent magnets), components (e.g. blades) or product level (e.g. new assets). Research analysing the implementation of circular business models in the wind industry is scarce. Such information could, however, support more robust decision-making in the development of system-level innovations for the deployment of more resource-efficient and sustainable wind energy infrastructure. Building upon practical methods for the identification, categorisation and characterisation of business models, 14 circular business models with application to the wind industry were comprehensively evaluated through the revision of 125 documents, including 56 journal papers, 46 industrial business cases and 23 wind technology management reports. Each circular business model is examined according to i) business offering and drivers, ii) value creation, delivery and capture mechanisms, iii) sustainability benefits and trade-offs, and iv) industrial challenges and opportunities. Accordingly, comprehensive guidelines to drive political (legislation design and implementation), industrial (technology and business innovation) and academic (further research) actions, are provided. Though the results are focussed on the wind industry, the general findings and recommendations are relevant across the renewable and low-carbon energy sector.},

 abstract = {Decentralized systems applied at the point-of-use (POU) could be an alternative for a safe drinking water supply in isolated regions and developing countries. Based on that, it was investigated the recycling of end-of-life reverse osmosis (EoL-RO) household modules as an alternative for groundwater treatment at the POU. The membranes were recycled through chemical oxidation using NaOCl (440,000~ppm~h) and were validated in a long-term operation. The systems operated in a dead-end configuration mode without external energy requirements for permeation, only the hydraulic force provided by the water grid. The increase in permeability from 4.5 to 50.4~L/m2h.bar and decrease in salinity rejection from 99.4 to 11.6{\%} suggests that the EoL-RO was effectively converted to ultrafiltration (UF). The recycled membrane still presented a lower resistance to filtration due to its porous characteristics (average pore size 0.04~$\pm$~0.01~\textgreek{m}m). In the perspective of POU application, the lower energy requirement for the recycled membranes compared to EoL-RO would represent advantages if compared to reverse osmosis household modules, more energy-demanding filters. Effective water treatment and a low fouling propensity were observed for long-term operation at the POU. The monitoring data demonstrates a steady permeate flux (21.2~$\pm$~0.46~L/m2h) and filtration resistance (6.37~$\pm$~0.16 $\times${\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is={\textquotedbl}true{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}{\textless}mo linebreak={\textquotedbl}goodbreak{\textquotedbl} linebreakstyle={\textquotedbl}after{\textquotedbl} is={\textquotedbl}true{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}$\times${\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} 1014 1/m), producing a total permeate volume (3,000~L) comparable with commercial filtration systems and in compliance with the 109 potability standards analyzed.

 abstract = {53,000 tonnes of blade waste from on-shore wind farms will potentially be generated in Ireland by 2040. The recycling of blades, which are made from composite material, is costly and thus far no high volume recycling solution exists. Repurposing blades into second life structures is an alternative which is gaining in popularity, but has many challenges. Green Public Procurement has the potential to help drive demand for blade products in Irish public works. The Re-Wind project has generated a Design Atlas with 47 blade product concepts and these are screened for their ability to overcome repurposing challenges. Three Irish scenarios are developed based on this ranking, maximal utilization of the blade, and on the end customer. Life Cycle Assessment is used to determine the marginal environmental impacts of the raw material substitution provided by the use of blade material. Focusing on greenhouse gas emissions, an estimated 342~kg CO2 e can be saved for every tonne of blade waste used in these scenarios. Blade substitution of steel products was found to provide the most impact, followed by substitution of concrete products. Although repurposing is unlikely to offer an end-of-life solution for all Irish blade waste, the use of 20{\%} of this material annually would divert 315 tonnes of blade waste from landfill, as well as avoiding emissions of 71,820~kg CO2 e. Green procurement has the potential to create a demand for repurposed blade products, which in turn could create jobs in high unemployment areas. Utilization of repurposed, local material could contribute to creating resiliency in supply chains. Both job creation and supply chain resiliency are essential for a post-Covid recovery in Ireland.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of the energy harvesting potential from wave-induced motions when producing electricity by linear generators installed on ships. The study estimates an upper maximum energy extraction potential by not considering the electro-mechanical coupling; neither is mechanical and electrical dissipation considered. The analysis of the harvested energy is made using simulated data in a case study investigating three different ships (by size). Specifically, the case study reveals that, in moderate to mildly severe sea states, the power harvested from the environment using linear generators may reach values around 1--2 kW/tons of seismic mass. Thus, it is unrealistic to imagine ship designs where linear generators are thought to provide a ship's necessary propulsion power but, on the other hand, they may serve to supplement the main engine for auxiliary power generation.},

 abstract = {The rapid increase in electronic waste, driven by the widespread use of electronic devices, poses significant environmental challenges due to its classification as hazardous waste. Among these, end-of-life solar panels present a growing concern, as improper disposal can lead to the release of toxic pollutants. Recycling these panels not only prevents environmental contamination but also optimizes resource and energy use. This study focuses on repurposing silicon from discarded panels to synthesize cordierite, a material with industrial applications. The synthesis process involves the thermal treatment of silicon obtained from waste panels, combined with kaolinitic clay and bischofite, which acts as a chlorinating agent. Non-isothermal experiments were conducted within a temperature range of 20--900{\&}nbsp;°C to evaluate the effects of temperature on the reaction process and impurity behavior. Additionally, isothermal experiments were performed to assess the impact of reaction time. The reaction mechanism was also analyzed. The results revealed that cordierite begins to form at 700{\&}nbsp;°C through the reaction of evolved mullite and enstatite in a chlorine atmosphere. At 600{\&}nbsp;°C, iron impurities in the clay undergo chlorination, forming volatile FeCl$_3$. Optimal conditions for the process were identified at 900{\&}nbsp;°C with a reaction duration of 120{\&}nbsp;min, enabling the selective synthesis of cordierite and the effective removal of iron and vitreous silica impurities.},

@article{PerezMartinez.2021,
 abstract = {Reuse is considered as a priority alternative for the management of Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). The reason is that it is thought that reuse always has a lower environmental impact. However, few studies have evaluated in detail the environmental impacts of reuse, and even fewer have analysed cases of reuse for a purpose other than the original one. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) following the ISO 14040 standard, was employed to assess the environmental impacts of two preparing for reuse processes of desktop computer considered as WEEE, whose results were repurposed products with industrial application: a programmable logic controller (PLC) and a perimeter security system (PSA). These scenarios were compared with other equivalents in which the products come from virgin raw materials. The results showed a worse environmental performance of repurposed PLC than one original, due mainly to differences in distribution and use stages. The greater weight, the shorter lifespan and mainly the higher operating power were responsible for the greater negative effects of the reuse scenario. However, repurposed PSA has a lower negative impact than original equipment in all environmental categories analysed. This was mainly due to its lower operating power and also not having demanding technical characteristics. Therefore, in this case, the usage profile, the composition and the lifespan can be considered as the main factors that determine the environmental advantage of repurposed products. The main conclusion of this work is that the environmental viability of the reuse of WEEE depends on the existing commercial alternatives for the application of the new product obtained; being one of the main factors the power consumption and the lifespan. This constitutes an important aspect to take into account when developing regulations, strategies and policies to prevent the implementation of WEEE management systems with environmental impacts greater than other alternatives. Further, the specific information about environmental performance of repurposing can contribute to the development of new processes of preparing for reuse. In this way, the commercialization of new products from these processes is favoured, which contributes to improving the environmental management of WEEE and the development of the circular economy.},

 abstract = {A rapid growth in electric vehicles has led to a massive number of retired batteries in the transportation sector after 8--10 years of use. However, retired batteries retain over 60{\%} of their original capacity and can be employed in less demanding electric vehicles or stationary energy storage systems. As a result, the management of end-of-life electric vehicles has received increased attention globally over the last decade due to their environmental and economic benefits. This work presents knowledge and technology for retired electric vehicle batteries that are applicable to the Thai context, with a particular focus on a case study of a retired lithium-ion battery from the Nissan X-Trail Hybrid car. The disassembled battery modules are designed for remanufacturing in small electric vehicles and repurposing in energy storage systems. The retired batteries were tested in a laboratory under high C-rate conditions (10C, 20C, and 30C) to examine the limitations of the batteries' ability to deliver high current to electric vehicles during the driving operation. In addition, the electric motorcycle conversion has also been studied by converting the gasoline engine to an electric battery system. Finally, the prototypes were tested both in the laboratory and in real-world use. The findings of this study will serve as a guideline for the sorting and assessment of retired lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles, as well as demonstrate the technical feasibility of reusing retired batteries in Thailand.},

 abstract = {As a result of population growth and potable water scarcity, an increasing number of reverse osmosis desalination plants are being installed and operated (more than 15,000 in the world). Reverse osmosis membranes tend to reach the end of the life cycle in around two to five years, becoming a solid waste. Recycling/repurposing these aged membranes could be a sustainable and profitable solution. This project aimed to transform end-of-life reverse osmosis membranes through the oxidation of their active layer using chlorine into nanoporous/microporous membranes, while searching possible applications for the resulting membranes. The results show that membranes oxidized at 10,000 ppm.h had a significant increase in permeability (3.1x), reaching NF-like capacity. On the other hand it was observed a decrease in the rejection of salt (4.35x) and acetaminophen (1.5x). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) shows the positive effect of chlorine in the complete removal of particles deposited over the membrane. This oxidation condition also increased the average roughness (2.42x) of the membrane, as shown by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Analysis by Fourier Transform Reflectance Spectroscopy (FTIR) suggests that chlorine oxidation replaced the hydrogen in the amide nitrogen. Both FTIR and SEM suggests the polyamide layer was not fully degraded. Application tests suggests that the recycled membrane can be used for the treatment of brackish and surface waters. The recycling of reverse osmosis membranes can be an alternative to simple landfill disposal, allowing owners to shift from disposal cost to revenue, as well as being a sustainable solution. The high permeability achieved on these oxidized membranes suggest many other NF/UF functions could potentially use recycled RO membranes.},

 abstract = {Previous research focused on the development of guidelines to load rate highway bridges constructed out of repurposed railroad flatcars (RRFCs). Those guidelines were based on field testing and finite element analysis conducted on existing RRFC bridges both in the field and in the lab. However, load rating is only one of the issues related to RRFCs as the main components are often classified as fracture critical members (FCMs) since there are only two flatcars in the cross section in most instances. Classifying the individual RRFCs as FCMs requires a rigorous hands-on inspection as per the Code of Federal Regulations, which greatly increases the long-term costs associated with these structures. Hence, while they are attractive to many owners due to their low initial costs and considerable strength, long-term costs due to inspection have deterred some owners from utilizing this viable and renewable alternative for low-volume applications. This paper presents the results of laboratory testing and non-linear finite element analysis of a railroad flatcar bridge specimen constructed with a composite reinforced concrete deck. The results confirm that RRFCs have considerable reserve strength and adequate load redundancy in a severely faulted state and need not be classified as FCMs if certain requirements are met. The paper also presents recommendations for load redistribution factors between primary members of RRFCs obtained through the experimental and verified by numerical studies.},

Then, a multi-period, multi-objective mixed-integer possibilistic linear programming model is developed to jointly make several strategical and tactical decisions. The original possibilistic model is then converted to its crisp counterpart using the robust possibilistic programming approach. The proposed model is applied to the smartphone network in Iran as the case study. Several sensitivity analyses are also carried out whose results demonstrate the superiority of circular supply chain network model versus the linear model for electronic devices. Also, the collaboration of industrial players can notably affect the total profit and carbon emission, especially if they are located together in an eco-industrial park. The findings also reveal that incentive schemes can increase the number of returned products in the reverse flow and consequently make a rise in the circular supply chain's revenue.},

The construction-operation-decommissioning cycle is likely to take 20-30 years and whilst decommissioning may not be undertaken for many years, its management needs to be addressed in both current and future marine management regimes. This can be defined within a Drivers-Activities-Pressures-State Changes-Impacts (on human Welfare)-Responses framework. This paper considers the main decommissioning options - partial or complete removal of all components. A SWOT analysis shows environmental and economic benefits in partial as opposed to complete removal, especially if habitat created on the structures has conservation or commercial value. Benefits (and repercussions) are defined in terms of losses and gains of ecosystem services and societal benefits. The legal precedents and repercussions of both options are considered in terms of the 10-tenets of sustainable marine management. Finally a 'renewables-to-reefs' programme is proposed.},

Findings indicate that a single company generates over six tons of textile waste per month, which equates to approximately EUR 25,000 annually in landfill disposal costs. By implementing a circular alternative that uses just 8.75{\%} of these materials, an economic saving of around EUR 750 per year was reached. In addition, a low-cost vacuum molding method was tested for producing stoppers, yielding aesthetically pleasing and durable prototypes. The application of a materials circularity index enabled the identification of optimal remnants for reintroduction into the production cycle. This re-integration not only reduces the reliance on virgin plastic materials, but also has the potential to significantly reduce the overall environmental impact across interconnected sectors. Ultimately, this study highlights the viability of adopting circular economy practices within the leather goods sector to promote sustainability and economic efficiency.},

Handling end-of-life waste from wind turbine blades (WTBs) is equally pressing. Currently, WTB waste often finds its way into landfills, emphasizing the need for recycling and sustainable solutions. Mechanical recycling of composite WTB presents an avenue for the recovery of glass fibers (GF) for repurposing as fillers or reinforcements. The resulting composite materials exhibit improved properties compared to the pure PAN polymer. Through the employment of the dry-jet wet spinning technique, we have successfully manufactured PAN/GF coaxial-layered fibers with a 0.1 wt {\%} GF content in the middle layer. These fibers demonstrate enhanced mechanical properties and a lightweight nature. Most notably, the composite fiber demonstrates a significant 24.4{\%} increase in strength and a 17.7{\%} increase in modulus. These fibers hold vast potential for various industrial applications, particularly in the production of structural components (e.g., electric vehicles), contributing to enhanced performance and energy efficiency.},

With increasing automobiles in the past decade, more and more discarded air filters (DAFs) have caused severe environmental pollution due to automobile maintenance. We proposed an efficient and simple method for preparing superhydrophobic/superoleophilicity air filter for oil/water separation to solve this problem. The DAFs were functionalized by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles to enhance its hydrophobicity and oleophilicity. The morphological study showed that the use of PDMS as a binder changed the surface structure of the coatings significantly. Oil/water separation experiments revealed that DAFs could separate various oils with separation efficiencies exceeding 99{\%}. Importantly, Experiments have shown that the superhydrophobic/oleophilic air filter cartridge maintains a high separation efficiency ({\textgreater}96{\%}) after at least ten filter cycles under oil-water mixtures with alkaline, acidic, and saline solutions. The superoleophobicity of DAFs was maintained in solutions of alkaline, acidic, and saline solutions for at least 72 h, indicating good durability and stability. More importantly, the DAFs not only removes oil from oily wastewater (such as in tanker leaks) but also realizes secondary use.},

Geothermal energy undoubtedly has great potential, particularly thermal energy, given that 48{\%} of the final energy consumption in the EU20 countries in 2021 was related to heating and cooling systems. The present study verifies and compares the feasibility of realizing district heating systems in two different contexts: (i) depleted hydrocarbon fields with the repurposing of existing hydrocarbon wells into geothermal wells and (ii) areas with documented geothermal resources. The two selected case studies are located, respectively, near Romentino (Northern Italy, province of Novara) and Tuscania (Central Italy, province of Viterbo). Following an assessment of the geothermal resources in the two selected case studies, specific methodological tools have been developed to evaluate the energy demand in the municipalities and determine the projects' economics. Both case studies show positive economic indices assuming heat tariffs aligned with the values recorded in the 2020--2021 period. However, our results show how reusing hydrocarbon wells in geothermal wells constitutes an excellent opportunity to access geothermal resources, significantly reducing the necessary investment and the mining risk and strongly improving the economics of the projects.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an investigation into the feasibility of repurposing end-of-life notebook computers as thin client computers. Repurposing is the identification of a new use for a product that can no longer be used in its original form and has the potential to become a hybrid re-use/recycling end-of-life strategy for suitable e-waste when direct reuse is not economically or technically feasible. In this instance, it was targeted to produce thin client computers using motherboards, processors and memory from used laptops while recycling all other components.

Notebook computers are of interest for this type of strategy due to having a substantial environmental impact in manufacturing but often not having the option of direct reuse as they are prone to damage and experience a rapid loss of value over time. They also contain multiple critical raw materials with very low recycling rates.

The notebook computers were sourced from Civic Amenity sites (CA) and originated from business-to-consumer (B2C) channels.

A total of 246 notebook computers were collected and analysed. The paper outlines a methodology developed to identify, test, analyse, and disassemble suitable devices for repurposing. The methodology consists of the following stages with associated pass rates; Visual Inspection {\&} Power-on Test (32{\%}) the Initial-stage functionality test comprised of Functionality Test (56{\%}), Diagnostics (100{\%}) and Benchmarking (86{\%}).

The Disassembly stage had a pass rate of 100{\%} and the Post-Disassembly Test comprised of a Validation test (86{\%}). The Final-stage functionality test had a pass rate of 61{\%}.

The overall results show that 9{\%} of the notebook computers were suitable for repurposing as thin client computers. It recommends the following design changes to notebooks/laptops that would support repurposing; 1) PCB mounted Fan and Heatsink assembly, 2) Eliminate daughter and I/O boards, 3) A separate Power Button assembly, 4) Reduction in size of the motherboards surface area or physical size. These design changes would allow for a more efficient transition for a change of role.

A streamlined lifecycle analysis based on Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) was undertaken to compare the impact of repurposed notebook computers with new thin client computers. The results indicated that there are significant potential savings to be made by extending lifetimes and offsetting the production of new thin client computers under a range of assumptions.},

The purpose of the research is to compare the relative sustainability of alternative ways to deal with this waste, these being: landfill, incineration with heat recovery, co-processing in cement kilns, making furniture and bridge fabrication. The method is to use the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to select 11 metrics for sustainability. The use of the SDGs adds to the objectivity of this process overcoming one of the principal weaknesses of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Quantitative information methods from Life Cycle Assessment, Geographic Information Science, census data and real options analysis of R{\&}D, alongside qualitative information from Delphi studies and Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats analysis are combined in the assessment. Three MCDA methods are used, each calculates economic, social and environmental sustainability indices for the end-of-life alternatives which are then combined into integrated sustainability indices. A novel Delphi stopping condition based on consensus, consistency and convergence is used. The primary result is that bridge fabrication is the most sustainable alternative with furniture making in second place. Co-processing, incineration with heat recovery and landfill are progressively less sustainable alternatives. This result is robust to substantial changes in the selection of experts' opinions, the weights for MCDA and the values of the metrics. These findings offer researchers and policymakers a robust decision making process, applicable to situations where choices are made on sustainability criteria.},

 abstract = {The adoption of electric vehicles is increasing in a global trend toward decarbonization, yet the overall sustainability of these vehicles still poses many questions. The sourcing of many critical raw materials in battery production and their poorly-defined end-of-life management are among the underlined environmental challenges. The sustainability of battery placement in the transportation system in this sense needs to be supported by circular end-of-life strategies. While battery recycling for a secondary supply can be more favourable for producers, reuse disposition is regarded as being more environmentally attractive from a holistic lifecycle perspective. Cascading the life of batteries as such to reduce the environmental burdens is considered by both regulatory and industrial bodies. However, the uncertainties in cost breakdown and reliability of repurposed batteries reflected in na{\"i}ve second-life market alignment and financial justification are barriers to current reuse policies and practices. For batteries with a variable lifetime subject to technical constraints in every application, the financial dynamics which underpin the choices of how and where to deploy them are challenging to investigate. While present studies make static assumptions about battery lifetime and operating costs, this work develops a dynamic investigation by incorporating battery degradation in hosts of different second-life applications into the financial analysis. This goal is approached by estimating the lifetime of the batteries in cascaded applications, and further evaluating their second-life contribution to energy and non-energy services in power systems. Findings indicate that settling on a lower purchase price for retired batteries and reducing the number of energy trading results in a justifiable return-on-investment. For batteries in early-failure vehicles such as 4-years-old, this arrangement is equally profitable compared to new ones when going below 26{\%} of the original battery cell price, yet for older batteries such as 10-year-olds, the best performance is expected when contributing to grid services while keeping the investment value below 15{\%}.},

 abstract = {As EVs becoming a viable choice in transportation systems, worries arise about the massive amount of environmentally hazardous electrochemical waste generated at end of life. A sustainable life cycle approach suggests exploring well-defined waste management strategies to deal with the upcoming waste. These strategies either aim at recycling if there is no potential for a second life or repurposing if the end-of-life automobile batteries are sufficiently healthy. However, the health of end-of-life batteries are not the only measure for their feasibility in a second application and it partly depends on the financial viability as well. Second life market alignment, the sensible second-use profit-making considering revenue-cost balance as well as other suppliers' side inertias and preferences for battery secondary supply instead of reuse must be enlightened in a circular waste management system. This work aims to address some of the financial considerations of battery reuse by conducting a marginal revenue-cost analysis for energy services in the Irish electricity market while incorporating the battery technical limitations into the assessment. The marginal analysis shows how much investment in reused batteries would keep the financial balance of the system. Results show that the investment of retired batteries with 90{\%} SOH for arbitrage trading in the imbalance energy market would be profitable when their purchase price is below average 60{\%} of the batteries' original price, while for 85{\%} and 80{\%}, this value is estimated up to 25{\%} and 20{\%}, respectively. However, hybridizing their operation with other non-energy services would make their investment more profitable.},

@article{Johst.2023,
 abstract = {The rapidly growing wind industry poses a fundamental problem for wind turbine blade (WTB) disposal in many areas of the world. WTBs are primarily manufactured from composites consisting of a thermoset matrix and reinforcing fibers. Currently, there are no economically viable recycling technologies available for such large-scale composite products. Thus, other treatment strategies for disposed WTBs have to be considered. This study explores the repurpose of WTBs as a promising alternative approach from a processual and technological point of view. For this purpose, the study is guided by the categorization into four different types of repurposed applications: high-loaded complete structure (T1), low-loaded complete structure (T2), high-loaded segmented structure (T3), and low-loaded segmented structure (T4). A three-dimensional CAD model of an Enercon-40/500 (E40) wind turbine blade is derived in a reverse engineering procedure to obtain knowledge about the actual geometry of the WTB. Based on the design, three ecosystems of product scenarios (S) with different manufacturing technologies involved are investigated: a climbing tower (S1), a playground (S2) and the combination of a photovoltaic (PV)-floating pontoon, and a lounger (S3). A screening life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to evaluate the three repurposed scenarios according to environmental aspects. It is shown that the repurpose of E40 WTB composite material can reduce the environmental impact and leads to significant resource savings in relation to a reference product of similar quality. A particularly high saving potential is identified for the substitution of emission-intensive materials in construction applications. Furthermore, it is found that transport processes are the primary contributor to the environmental impact of repurposed applications.},

@article{Joustra.2021,
 abstract = {Composite materials offer many advantages during the use phase, but recovery at the end of a lifecycle remains a challenge. Structural reuse, where an end of life product is segmented into construction elements, may be a promising alternative. However, composites are often used in large, complex shaped products with optimised material compositions that complicate reuse. A systematic approach is needed to address these challenges and the scale of processing. We investigated structural reuse taking wind turbine blades as a case product. A new segmentation approach was developed and applied to a reference blade model. The recovered construction elements were found to comply to geometric construction standards and to outperform conventional construction materials on specific flexural stiffness and flexural strength. Finally, we explored the reuse of these construction elements in practice. Together, the segmentation approach, structural analysis and practical application provide insights into design aspects that enable structural reuse.},

@article{Kamath.2020,
 abstract = {The volume of end-of-life automotive batteries is increasing rapidly as a result of growing electric vehicle adoption. Most automotive lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are recycled but could be repurposed as second-life batteries (SLBs) since they have 70-80{\%} residual capacity, which can be adequate for stationary applications. SLBs have been proposed as potential, inexpensive, low-carbon energy storage for residential and utility-level applications, with or without photovoltaics (PV). However, it is unknown whether SLBs will be better than new batteries and whether SLBs will provide similar cost and carbon emission reduction for the different stationary applications in all locations. This work compared the levelized cost of electricity and life-cycle carbon emissions associated with using SLBs and new LIBs in the US for three energy storage applications: (1) residential energy storage with rooftop PV, (2) utility-level PV firming, and (3) utility-level peak-shaving, leading to a total of 41 scenarios. SLBs reduced the levelized cost of electricity by 12-57{\%} and carbon emissions by 7-31{\%} compared to new LIBs in the considered applications, with higher reductions for utility-level applications. SLBs still provided benefits at the residential level when compared to rooftop PV alone by reducing the levelized cost by 15-25{\%} and carbon emissions by 22-51{\%}, making SLBs attractive to residential consumers as well. SLBs offer an opportunity to utilize an end-of-life product for energy storage applications, provided the uncertainty in SLB quality and availability is addressed.},

 abstract = {This study describes creating textile waste-based cellulosic composites (TWCCs) by upcycling used cotton fabrics. The research aims to develop a new fully/partially biodegradable composite material using textile waste obtained during the production process of textile materials. Textile waste poses a significant environmental challenge due to its accumulation in landfills. This study explores the potential of repurposing textile waste into composite materials through advanced manufacturing techniques. Three distinct sample types are developed for the comparative study of the characteristics: TWCCs, TWCC laminate, and cotton/epoxy TWCC composite laminate. The fabrication process is optimized to enhance the TWCC mechanical and thermal characteristics. The structural integrity and performance of the developed composite materials are assessed by mechanical testing, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the developed composite's biodegradability was investigated. The results show that TWCCs{\&}nbsp;made from textile waste have the potential to be an effective way to lower environmental pollution, encourage circular economy principles in the manufacturing industry, and provide good mechanical properties for various applications.},
