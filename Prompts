Prompt RQ1: For product example high-voltage battery from an electric car.

Problem description
Many products contain components that remain functional after the end of their original use. One challenge is to find follow-up applications for such components instead of disposing of them. Such repurposing scenarios refer to the reuse of a component in a different technical system environment, whereby its physical function can be retained but is used in a new application context. 
For a repurposing scenario to be technically feasible, certain necessary properties of the component and the target system must match. 
Task:
Review the given problem description and name 10 possible repurposing scenarios for a high-voltage battery from an electric car. The scenarios must be technically feasible and name a plausible target system.
Use the following format Component | Target system
